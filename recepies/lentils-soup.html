<h3>Ingredients</h3>
For four portion, you will need:
<ul>
  <li>2/3 onions</li>
  <li>1/2 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>5 grams of ginger</li>
  <li>Timian</li>
  <li>3 carrots</li>
  <li>1 aubergine</li>
  <li>100 grams of red lentils (the small one that will melt)</li>
  <li>100 grams of brown lentils</li>
  <li>A can of tomato paste (something like Mutti)</li>
  <li>3/4 potatoes</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Preparation</h3>
You need a large tall pot for this recepie.
Make a soffritto with the onions, carrots and garlic.
I keep the garlic whole, but you may prefer it sliced.
Dice the aubergine in small cubes and add them to the pot.
Add the ginger, chopped very fine, add the lentils.
Add the tomato paste and water until it reaches 1 cm above the ingredients.
Peel and cut the potatoes in small pieced and add the timian.
Once it boils, cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer at low heat for around 1 hour.
The soup is ready when it thickens and it has a dark orange color.
A small amount of olive oil <i>at cold</i> before serving is a nice final touch.
