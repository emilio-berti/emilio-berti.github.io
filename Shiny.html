	<h2> Bifuractions of the logistic map </h2>
		In 1976, Robert May wrote a paper that always strucks me as one of the best piece of theoretical ecology<a target="_self" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. I replicated part of his results in <a target="_self" href="https://popecology.shinyapps.io/logistic_bifurcations/">this Shiny app</a> that shows the dynamic map of a population subject to logistic growth and the bifurcations of such dynamics. A more detailed explanation of what is happening and why can be found on my blog: <a target="_self" href="https://popecology.home.blog/2020/01/18/1-2-4-chaos/">popecology</a>.
