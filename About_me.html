			I am very fascinated by ancient history of the Mediterranean basin, in particular of Greek and Roman civilizations and of that mysterious people that called themselves <i>Rasenna</i>, who appeared from nowhere to rule on the hills of Tuscany and then to slowly fade into oblivion. I strongly believe that the Anabasis by Xenohpon will be a great hit on Netflix soon.
