		<h3> Why this webpage? </h3>
		<p> 
			As I go forward with my career and life, I started needing to collect all information about myself in one place. Hence, I made this webpage that, without relying on other social platforms, contains all I need.
		</p>
		<h3> Why does this webpage look so ugly? </h3>
		<p> 
			I wrote this webpage in basic html. I wanted a webpage with flat design, easy to follow, and forgiving towards mobile data. There is beauty also in simplicity, sometimes.
