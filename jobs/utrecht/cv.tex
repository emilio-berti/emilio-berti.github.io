\begin{rSection}{Education}
Since my first lab experience during my BSc, it was clear to me and others that I excelled in quantitative biology.
At the time, I was particularly intrigued by human physiology and I joined the physiology lab lead by Prof. Marco Linari, where I received a BSc degree studying the structural effects of the protein myopalladin on muscle fibers.
After this, I moved to Pavia (Italy) to enroll in one of the most prestigious neurobiology curriculum offered in Italy.
However, most of the topics I was really interested in required a strong mathematical background, which I did not have.
I quit neurobiology and returned to Florence, where I was too late to enroll in another curriculum and had to wait the next academic year.
I spent this year studying mathematics on my own and attended public courses of linear algebra and data analysis offered by the department of physics.
I did not want that the lack of mathematical skills would jeopardize again the type of research I wanted to conduct; so far, this personal training has been very helpful during my career to investigate the research questions I was interested in. Together with neurobiology, Ecology was the other course that captivated me during my BSc.
I thus enrolled the next academic year in the Ecology curriculum in Florence.
For the first time, I felt a deep connection with my studies and was extremely motivated by its intellectual challenge.
I joined the lab of Prof. Giacomo Santini, where I studied the behavior of ants during conflict.
After obtaining the MSc in Florence, I moved to Aarhus (Denmark), where I joined as a PhD student the lab of Prof. Jens-Christian Svenning, where I studied how the extinctions of megafauna caused by humans have impacted ecosystems worldwide. 
I published two peer-reviewed papers in prestigious international journals and successfully defended my PhD dissertation three years after the start of the PhD.

\begin{rSection}{Research interests}
My main research interests lay at the intersection of species interactions, community assembly, and biodiversity loss due to climate change and human pressure.
I was first exposed to these topics during my MSc by Prof. Guido Chelazzi and his book \textit{L'impronta originale. Storia naturale della colpa ecologica}, which introduced me to the deep-time impacts that humans have had on ecosystems.
I broadened and deepened these interests by joining the lab of Prof. Jens-Christian Svenning at Aarhus University for my PhD.
Here, I studied the effects of human-driven extinctions on ecosystem connectivity (published in Global Ecology and Biogeography) and how human perception of species is biases towards large charismatic species (published in Biological Conservation).
During my PhD, I also investigated how the networks of trophic interactions have been altered by human-driven extinctions and how rewilding may help restoring such losses using species distribution models (published as a chapter in my dissertation).
During the last months of my PhD, I tried to secure funding for myself by applying to the Royal Society Industry Fellowship in 2020 with a project titled \textit{Evolutionary attractors of populations} that aimed at quantifying the demographic fragility of species in fluctuating environments.
Despite unsuccessful, this project exposed me to basic demographic theory and to the field of stochastic demography.

After my PhD, I was briefly employed by a research institution in Denmark, but decided to move to iDiv in Germany and pursue a PostDoc position in theoretical ecology, integrating the fields of macroecology, biogeography, and ecological networks.
	During my stay at iDiv, I focused on advancing the mechanistic understanding of animal movement (published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution and in Plos Biology), on investigating how species interactions shape community assembly at local and regional scales (published in Ecology Letters), its influence on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (accepted in Functional Ecology as \textit{Amyntas, A., \textbf{Berti, E.}, \dots, Brose, U. -- Niche complementarity among plants and animals can alter the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship}), and how these upscale to the landscape and ecosystem level (in preparation).
Moreover, I have been focusing during the last year on how inter-annual climate variability shape species' distribution and developed a novel approach that integrates stochastic demography with species' distribution modeling to account for it.
This is urgently needed to accurately projects of the spatial patterns of biodiversity will change in the future due to climate change, which is altering also the climate variability, a factors that is important in shaping species' distribution but that most SDMs currently ignore.
	I also have been in charge of releasing the new version of the open-access food-web database \href{https://idata.idiv.de/ddm/Data/ShowData/283?version=3}{GATEWAy} and collaborated in other projects to help conservation of large mammals in Africa (published in Biological Conservation) and Nepal (under review as \textit{Carter, N., \textbf{Berti, E.}, Zuckerwise, A., and Pradhan, N. -- Energetics-based connectivity mapping reveal new conservation opportunities for the endangered tiger in Nepal}), to assess the drivers of lead concentration at global scale (under review as \textit{Wei, S., \textbf{Berti, E.}, \dots, Yue, K. -- Global patterns and drivers of lead concentration in inland waters}) and to use food web theory to quantify nature contributions to people (under reivew at Trends in Ecology and Evolution as \textit{Antues, A.C., \textbf{Berti, E.}, \dots, Gauzens, B. -- Linking biodiversity, ecosystem function and natureâ€™s contributions to people (NCP): a macroecological energy flux perspective}).
\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Skills}
I have acquired a very competitive set of skills from my unique career path: I have developed an outstanding mathematical and theoretical skill set through personal training and successfully applied it to investigate macroecological and biogeographical drivers of biodiversity and species interaction networks.
I try to get the best from each experience; I have failed many times and will fail again, but this is also an opportunity to learn new things and incorporate them into my personal and professional growth.
