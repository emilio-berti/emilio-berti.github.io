    <h2> Our Mission </h2>
    </header>
      <p> This project aims to assess the number and distribution of wild horse populations in Europe. 
          To achieve this, we use social media platforms (i.e. flickr, instagram) to help identify where these populations are located. 
          Using this prelimiary data, we send surveys to all users with potential relevant information about wild horse populations to assess:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Status of the population.</li>
        <li>Current management strategies.</li>
        <li>Current funding sources (e.g. Rewilding Europe).</li>
        <li>Current threats and protection status of the populations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our ultimate goal is to establish a network of local associations supported by academic institutions to promote wild horse populations in Europe.
         This includes, among others, applying for EU fundings and leverage with stakeholders and local authorities in order 
         to promote normatives and legislations to protect wild horses.

    <h2> Manifesto </h2>
    </header>
      <ol>
        <li>Several horses populations have been release and became wild in the last decades.</li>
        <li>These populations promote important ecological functions and are a resource for biodiversity.</li>
        <li>Currently, there is little recognition for these populations and are, in most cases, at risk of being removed.</li>
        <li>There is also a lack of understanding of how widespread is this phenomenon in Europe.</li>
        <li>Moreover, a network is missing to coordinate efforts and exchange sucessfull management plans.</li>
        <li>We want to build this network starting from local associations and supported by academic institutions.</li>
        <li>After a first assessment of the above points and the creation of a repersentative network, we want to apply, as a community, to EU funds.</li>
        <li>Our goal is to highlight current gaps in the protection of wild horses and to actively propose economic and political solutions.</li>
