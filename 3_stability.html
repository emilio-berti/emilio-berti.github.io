		<h1> Ecosystems, complexity, and stability </h1>
		<p>
			Ecologists have tried to understand what drive the stability of ecosystems for many decades. For long time, ecologists believed that complex ecosystems, i.e. with many interacting species strongly controlling each others, were exceptionally stable. This idea came from the observation that real ecosystems are extremely complex and that such complexity should be necessary for ecosystems to persist through time and for us to observe them. Yet, few evidence of this theory existed. In 1972, May <a target="_self" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> published a revolutionary paper, which contradicted this idea and showed that, if anything, complexity is a destabilizing force in ecosystems and that the more complex an ecosystem, the more likely for it to be unstable and disappear. Yet, observation tells us that such complex ecosystems exist and that they persist through time. Hence, why do we observe such complex ecosystems in nature? This is the core question of the <b>complexity&ndash;stability</b> debate.
		</p>
		<h2> What do we mean by stability ? </h2>
		<p>
			There are many definitions of stability and many ways to investigate whether an ecosystem is stable or not. For the sake of this blogpost, stability is defined here as the property of a system to return, after an external perturbation, to its original state <a target="_self" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. For instance, this is the same definition of stability used by May <a target="_self" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. To investigate the relationship between complexity and stability, May resorted to two mathematical approaches, <b>stability theory</b> and <b>random matrix theory</b>, that had been developed for several decades. In particular, stability theory predicts that when mathematical quantities called "eigenvalues" &ndash; mythical and magical entities venerated by modellers &ndash; are all negative, then the ecosystem is stable. On the other hand, random matrix theory makes possible to predict the eigenvalues of the system, given some assumptions and limitations <a target="_self" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. Combining these two mathematical fields, May was thus able to understand the relation between ecosystems complexity and their stability. In particular, May studied how <b>random ecosystems</b> with random interactions behaved under increasing complexity.

			May found that for increasing complexity, i.e. increasing number of species and interactions, random systems are more likely to be unstable. To visualize this pattern I made a <a href = "https://popecology.shinyapps.io/fw_stability/" target = "_blank"> <b>Shiny app</b> </a> to play with. You can choose the <b>number of species</b> and the <b>connectance</b> of the ecosystem, which is the fraction of realized interactions over all possible links. You can also specify <b>&#961</b>, the overall pairwise correlation for the interactions between two species, and the <b>self-interaction strength</b>, which is the strength with which a species regulates itself; I will explain these two quantities shortly. An ecosystems is then randomly generated and displayed as a network and a matrix, with colors showing the strength of the interactions. I also added the possibility to switch from a pure random network model to *niche* model, which has a more realistic ecological structure than a purely random network. The two bottom figures are alternative ways to visualize if the ecosystem is stable or not. The figure with points (often resembling a Klingon battleship) show the eigenvalues of the system, while the figure with lines show a time series of the populations. The ecosystem is stable if and only if all eigenvalue points are on the left of the vertical dashed line and all lines reach and stay at zero <a target="_self" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>.

		<h2> Stable or not ? </h2>
		<p>
			Specifically, May found that the system is very likely to be unstable when:
		</p>
		$$
			\sigma \sqrt{SC} > -d
		$$
		<p>
			where &sigma; is the standard deviation of the interaction strength (here = 1), <i>S</i> is the number of species, <i>C</i> the connectance, and <i>the selfinteraction strength</i>. Ecologically, this means that complex <b>random</b> ecosystems, i.e. with a great number of interactions (<i>SC</i>), are more unstable than simple ones. At the time May's work was published, this result came unexpected, as the mainstream consensus among ecologists was that complex ecosystems should be more stable, and generated a debate sill alive after almost 50 years.
