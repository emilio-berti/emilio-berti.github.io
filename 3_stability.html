		<h1> Ecosystems, complexity, and stability </h1>
		<p>
			Ecologists have tried to understand what drives the stability of ecosystems for many decades. For long time, we believed that complex ecosystems, i.e. with many interacting species strongly controlling each others, were exceptionally stable. Indeed, real ecosystems are extremely complex and, hence, intuition suggests that complexity is necessary for ecosystem to persist. In different words, if complex ecosystems would be unstable, we would not observe them. Evidence of the stabilizing effect of complexity are, however, quite rare and case-specific and hence the question: does complexity stabilize ecosystems?
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1972, May published a revolutionary paper <a target="_self" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> that contradicted a positive effect of complexity on ecosystem stability. In particular, May showed that, contrary to intution and common believes, complexity is a destabilizing force and that the more complex an ecosystem, the more likely for it to be unstable and disappear. This still does not explain an apparent contradiction: despite a general negative effect of stability on ecosystems, complex ecosystems do exist and persist through time. So, why do we observe such complex ecosystems? This is the core question of the <b>complexity&ndash;stability</b> debate.
		</p>
		<h2> What do we mean by stability? </h2>
		<p>
			There are many definitions of stability and many ways to investigate whether an ecosystem is stable or not. For the sake of this blogpost, stability is defined here as the property of a system to return, after an external perturbation, to its original state <a target="_self" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. This is the same definition of stability used by May <a target="_self" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. To investigate the relationship between complexity and stability, May resorted to two mathematical approaches that had been developed for several decades: <b>stability theory</b> and <b>random matrix theory</b>. Stability theory predicts that when mathematical quantities called <i>eigenvalues</i> &ndash; mythical and magical entities venerated by modellers &ndash; are all negative, then the ecosystem is stable. In other words, if we want to know whether an ecosystem is stable or not, we need to know its eigenvalues. Random matrix theory makes this possible by predicting the eigenvalues of the system, given some assumptions and limitations <a target="_self" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. Combining these two mathematical fields, May was able to understand the relation between ecosystems complexity and their stability. In particular, May studied how <b>random ecosystems</b> with random interactions behaved under increasing complexity, i.e. for increasing number of species and strength of interactions.
		</p>

		<p>
			May found that random ecosystems are more likely to be unstable at increasing complexity. To visualize this pattern I made a <a href = "https://popecology.shinyapps.io/fw_stability/" target = "_blank"> <b>Shiny app</b> </a> to play with. You can choose the <b>number of species</b> and the <b>connectance</b> of the ecosystem, which is the fraction of realized interactions over all possible links. You can also specify <b>&#961</b>, the overall pairwise correlation of the interaction between two species, and the <b>self-interaction strength</b>, which is the strength with which a species regulates itself; I will explain these two quantities shortly. An ecosystem is then randomly generated and displayed as a network and a matrix, with colors showing the strength of the interactions. I also added the possibility to switch from a pure random network model to a <i>niche model</i>, which has a more realistic ecological structure than a purely random network. The two bottom figures are alternative ways to visualize if the ecosystem is stable or not. The figure with points (often resembling a Klingon battleship) shows the eigenvalues of the system, while the figure with lines shows a time series of the populations. The ecosystem is stable if and only if all eigenvalues are on the left of the vertical dashed line and all lines reach and stay at zero <a target="_self" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>.
		</p>
		<h2> Stable or not? </h2>
		<p>
			May found that the system is very likely to be unstable when:
		</p>
		$$
			\sigma \sqrt{SC} > -d \qquad (1)
		$$
		<p>
			where &sigma; is the standard deviation of the interaction strength (here = 1), <i>S</i> is the number of species, <i>C</i> the connectance, and <i>d</i> the self-interaction strength. Ecologically, this means that complex <u>random</u> ecosystems, i.e. with a great number of interactions (<i>SC</i>), are more likely to be unstable than simple ones. Stability can be reached for such complex systems only if species self-regulation is sufficiently high to counteract interspecific interactions. Recently, Tang, Pawar & Allesina <a target="_self" href="#footnote-4">[5]</a> expanded May's equation to include an important missing piece: how the correlation between the interactions among two species affect ecosystem stability. In particular, Tang & collaborators found that ecosystems are most likely to be unstable when:
		</p>
		$$
			\sigma \sqrt{SC} (1 + \rho) > -d \qquad (2)
		$$
		<p>
			where <b>&#961</b> is the overall pairwise correlation of the interaction between two species. When ecosystems are completely random, &#961 = 0 and we obtain May's equation (1). However, when interactions are negatively correlated - for example in food webs - the quantity on the left of equation (2) decreases and ecosystems are more likely to be stable. The opposite is true when interactions are positively correlated - typically in mutualistic networks, e.g. plant-pollinator ecosystems. This can be nicely visualized in the eigenvalue figure; for decreasing &#961, the points tend to be squeezed within an ellipse oriented vertically, i.e. they move left-wards, indicating decreasing eigenvalues and hence higher probability of stability. For growing &#961, instead, the ellipse is oriented horizontally, increasing the probability of a positive eigenvalue and hence ecosystem instability.
		</p>
		<h2> Stability, persistence, and evolution </h2>
		<p>
			It's hard today to imagine the impact of May's findings, which showed how common sense and intuition were completely wrong and highlighted the intricate nature of the complexity-stability debate. Equally important, at least to me, are the findings of Tang & collaborators, who showed how other characteristics of ecosystems are pivotal in driving their stability. After a long time where stability was thought as dependent mostly on complexity, these new results revealed that the nature of the complexity-stability debate is even more intricate than what previously thought, with several factors playing a major role at different levels of ecosystems. 
		</p>
		<p>
			These two papers have had a strong repercussion on how I thought about the stability of complex ecosystems. For instance, we may conjecture that other factors are as important as complexity for ecosystem stability - and we will be right in doing so - but that these factors are very hard to identify or even notice. After 50 years of research, despite all advances and impressive results, we just scraped the surface of the complexity-stability debate. We can give only partial answers to what drives ecosystems stability and why we observe complex ecosystems. The problem is much harder than what it appeared and reductionist approaches, e.g. reducing stability of ecosystems only to interaction strengths, may be risky in the face of such complexity. I also consider another scenario: what if the original question was <i>wrong</i>? What if we didn't ask the right question?
		</p>
		<p>
			Humans are obsessed with the idea of stability. It is probably a very useful trait for a big ape like us that need some level of stability to survive and successfully raise offspring. Yet, this obsession partly drove theoretical ecology to focus on the idea that long-term stability is important and needed for ecosystems to persist. There are, however, other factors than <b>long-term stability</b> that may play a major role for ecosystem persistence. For instance, stable ecosystems may never reach an equilibrium in highly variable environments and it is possible that unstable ecosystems are maintained at equilibrium by external perturbation. These <b>transient dynamics</b> have been neglected for a long time, partly because they are much (<u>much</u>) harder to study. However, a shifting in focus from long-term stability to transient dynamics has slowly started in recent years. This may give us some new, important insights on what determines ecosystem stability and persistence. The two may even not be so strongly linked together; after all, what is stability if not stagnation, a force brutally opposed by evolution?
