The most known source of occurrence data are the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and iNaturalist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGBIF is a data aggregator, pulling data also from iNaturalist.\n\n\nOccurrence data usually record only the presence of species, i.e. the species was detected at that location, due to the absence of species being extremely difficult to record. However, because most ENMs require presence and absence data, absences are usually simulated assuming an underlying ecological process. We will cover this in more detail in the subsequent sections."

    "text": "Environmental data\nENM/SDM usually investigate the effect of climatic variables on species distribution. Although other environmental covariates can be included, such as pH, landcover type, etc., this course focuses only on climatic variables, which are always accounted for in ENM/SDM. Climate is the probability density function of weather events, such as average, minimum, and maximum temperature (K) and precipitation (mm). Because many centers and research institutes model climate, climatic data can be accessed from a large variety of sources. In addition, bioclimatic variables are often derived from raw climate data and aggregated into long-term (e.g., 30 years) averages. These bioclimatic normals are often the climatic layers used in ENM/SDM. Some of the most used databases for bioclimatic normals are WorldClim, CHELSA, and PRISM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nClimate data differ widely in how they are derived. They are not inter-changeable and often lead to different results."

    "text": "Modeling the niche\nEcological Niche Modeling is a general term that applies to many types of models, all of which try to infer the niche of species. In this course, we will focus on two ENM frameworks, one relying on a generalized linear model (GLM) and one on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm (Breiman 2001). I chose GLM and RF because they represent two extremes of algorithms used in ENM, highlighting their different advantages and limitations. To explain these two procedures, I will use simulated data for a virtual species. The data for this species is stored in virtual.csv.\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- read.csv(\"../data/virtual.csv\")\nhead(d)\n\n\n      BIO01 BIO12 occ\n1  9.987156   897   1\n2  9.333240   472   1\n3  9.853782   663   1\n4  7.313562  1025   1\n5  6.567688   689   1\n6 11.305479   807   1\n\n\nThis data frame has three columns. BIO01 and BIO12 are the average temperature and precipitation, respectively. occ is the occurrence status, namely if the species has been observed at that environmental conditions (1) or not (0).\n\nGLM\nThe simples GLM uses a quadratic curve and a binary (binomial) response. The quadratic curve assures the niche is convex, even though it does not allow asymmetric curves. In R, this is achieved using the following specifications.\n\n\nCode\nenm &lt;- glm(\n  occ ~ poly(BIO01, 2, raw = TRUE) + poly(BIO12, 2, raw = TRUE),\n  data = d,\n  family = binomial(\"logit\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe syntax poly(x, n, raw = TRUE) is used in R to fit a polynomial of degree n to x. raw = TRUE makes sure the actual polynomial of x are used, and not a transformed version of them.\n\n\nWe can the plot this inferred niche on top of the actual niche.\n\n\nCode\nz_inferred &lt;- z\n\n# use `x` and `y` generated before\nfor (j in seq_along(x)) {\n  z_inferred[j, ] &lt;- predict(\n    enm, \n    newdata = data.frame(BIO01 = x[j], BIO12 = y),\n    type = \"response\"\n  )\n}\n\nimage(\n  x, y, z_inferred,\n  xlab = \"BIO01\",\n  ylab = \"BIO12\",\n  col = hcl.colors(100, \"Fall\", rev = TRUE)\n)\ncontour(\n  x, y, z,\n  add = TRUE,\n  levels = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.2)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe colors now show the inferred niche using glm() and the contours the actual niche. You can see that the actual niche is not symmetrical, but the inferred niche is. This is a common bias of GLM ENM. However, for its simplicity, a GLM ENM performs reasonably well at capturing the optimal environmental value and the general decline of suitability away from it.\n\n\nRandom Forest (RF)\nRF is a powerful machine-learning algorithm that has been applied to ENM for several decades. RF has its advantages, but has a major issue: the niche is rarely convex. In fact, in most cases, the niche will be concave (the opposite of convex). In R, RF is achieved using the package randomForest with the following specifications.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(randomForest)\n\nenm &lt;- randomForest(\n  occ ~ BIO01 + BIO12,\n  data = d\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis throws a warning that can be silenced by specifying as.factor(occ), which makes randomForest() to consider a classification, rather than a regression, problem. However, we do not want this.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# decrease a bit the resolution to speed it up\nx &lt;- seq(4, 22, length.out = 100)\ny &lt;- seq(0, 2000, length.out = 100)\nz &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = length(y), ncol = length(x))\nz_inferred &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = length(y), ncol = length(x))\nfor (j in seq_along(x)) {\n  z[j, ] &lt;- l(x[j], mu[1], sigl[1], sigr[1]) * l(y, mu[2], sigl[2], sigr[2])\n  z_inferred[j, ] &lt;- predict(\n    enm, \n    newdata = data.frame(BIO01 = x[j], BIO12 = y),\n    type = \"response\"\n  )\n}\n\nimage(\n  x, y, z_inferred,\n  xlab = \"BIO01\",\n  ylab = \"BIO12\",\n  col = hcl.colors(100, \"Fall\", rev = TRUE)\n)\ncontour(\n  x, y, z,\n  add = TRUE,\n  levels = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.2)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the niche inferred by RF (colors) is very jagged. This is due to how RF works internally. We will not explain why this happens in this course, but we will highlight this feature of RF and discuss its implications several times. However, you can see that the predictions from the RF model follows, more or less, the shape of the actual niche (contour lines)."
