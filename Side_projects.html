		<h1> Side projects </h1>
		<p>
			Side projects are projects that I carry out in my free time. I enjoy working on them and I have fun being a little bit silly. It's also the best way to learn new things!

                <br></br>
		<h3> bEngo </h3>
		<p> 
			bEngo is a version of Bingo, but instead of numbers from 1 to 90 the cards have the numbers of the food additives as European standard, the misterious <a target="_self", href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_number">E-numbers</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am writing the bash script to pull the common name of the additives and their purpose in bash: <a target="_self", href="https://github.com/emilio-berti/bash_scripts/blob/master/bEngo">code</a>. I have still to understand how to retrieve the purpose of the additives efficiently. Then, I will make a table with random E-numbers (in R?) to print the cards for the game.

                        Da chimico un giorno avevo il potere <br>
			Di sposar gli elementi e farli reagire <br>
			Ma gli uomini mai mi riuscì di capire <br>
			Perché si combinassero attraverso l'amore <br>
			Affidando ad un gioco la gioia e il dolore <br>
                        </i>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is my boldest side project so far. I want to analyze food recipes with deep-learning approached to find novel recipes never seen before. I am thinking much about this, but haven't had much time to compile a high-quality database. I'm starving to start this one.

		<h3> Squirry meteo </h3>
		<p>
			I was not fully satisfied with weather apps, so I decided to start my own: <a target="_self", href="https://github.com/emilio-berti/squirry-meteo">Squirry meteo</a>. I am currently developing a webpage to be hosted on a public domain.
